Complete Course Template

[[ Header Content ]]
-- Header Content is any course-defining data, such as the title, banner,
-- and other parameters.

#COURSE:My Course!;
--	The title of the course.

#COURSETRANSLIT:My Course, Translated!;
--	The title of the course, transliterated into english.

#REPEAT:YES;
--	If this is present, the course does not end.
--	Useful for endless & workout courses.

#LIVES:4;
--	The maximum(?) number of lives attainable in the course. Enabling this will
--	automatically force your course into an Oni course.

#BANNER:My Banner.png;
--	A banner for your course.

#BACKGROUND:My Background.png;
--	A background for your course. Currently only available in SM5 and sm-ssc.

#STYLE:SINGLE,VERSUS;
--	Denote which styles may be played on this course. This is useful for
--	cloning courses for doubles and single styles.

#METER:Beginner:3;
--	A custom-set meter for that course difficulty. You may set the difficulty
--	for Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, Challenge and Edit difficulties.

[[ Song Content ]]
-- Song Content makes up the entries in the course,
-- and also allows for timed modifiers.

-- Modifiers can be assigned in a variety of formats, the most effective three being the following:

1.) Repeated Modifier Block w/ Length:
#MODS:TIME:0.500:LEN:0.500:MODS:2x;
#MODS:TIME:1.500:LEN:0.500:MODS:0.5x;

2.) Nested Modifier Block w/ Length:
#MODS:
	TIME:0.500:LEN:0.500:MODS:2x;
	TIME:1.500:LEN:0.500:MODS:0.5x;

3.) Nested Modifier Block w/ Ends:
#MODS:
	TIME:0.500:END:1.000:MODS:2x;
	TIME:1.500:END:1.500:MODS:0.5x;

#GAINSECONDS:60.5;
--	The number of seconds gained before starting a song. This and #LIVES are
--	mutually exclusive: you can either have one, the other, or none: both
--	is not possible. This is meant to be used for Survival courses.

#SONG:*:Medium:2x;
-- #SONG can take quite a variety of parameters, of which may be useful to you
-- for testing or other purposes.
-- * is a wildcard item, meaning that StepMania will always pick a random song
-- for this part of the course.
-- You can also replace with BEST*,WORST*,GRADEBEST*, or GRADEWORST*, where * 
-- is a number to retrive the first of each category above.
#SONG:BEST1:Medium:2x;
-- As well as that, you may also do Group Random, like such:
#SONG:Dance Dance Revolution 8th Mix/*:Medium:2x;
-- If the above is not applicable, StepMania will search for the song title as best it can, depending on what you give it:
#SONG:Xepher:Medium:2x;
-- Will simply search the title of the song.
#SONG:DDR Supernova/Xepher:Medium:2x;
-- Will search for the exact directory.

-- #SONG can also apply different effects on each entry in the course by adding
-- special modifiers to the modifiers segment:
#SONG:*:Medium:showcourse;
-- For example, forces the course to never be hidden, noshowcourse being the
-- reverse of such.

-- nodifficult also exists to disable a player from changing difficulties, 
-- barring the player from making it easier or harder ( Gauntlets & Survivals
-- do not allow you to change difficulties ).

-- Finally, award*, where * is a number, allows you to control how many lives
-- the player gains from successfully completing a course in Oni mode.

Finally, here's an example course:

#METER:Medium:8;
