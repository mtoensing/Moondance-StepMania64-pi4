Place announcer folders in this directory.

[Announcer format]
StepMania's announcers look for certain names. These can either be a single sound,
or a folder containing many sounds (of which one is picked at random).

[Announcer calls]
Grouped by Screen/Element that calls them, though only the sound/folder name for
each item is important.
